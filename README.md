### Introduction
This is the first version of the lyric quiz that's not completely embarrassing. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty bad, but I'm including it so I have a record of how my work has improved.


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6


### Project Status
This project is closed. There is a newer version, Lyric Quiz 2.0. It's better, still not perfect, but better.

### Sources
I started this pretty early in my JS education (before I learned the latest syntax) so I read a few tutorials on quiz apps. I learned the most with Web Dev Simplified (on Youtube), which is largely what this quiz is based on.
